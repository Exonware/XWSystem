## 📋 **Project Development Roadmap**

The eXonware ecosystem follows a structured 5-phase development approach designed to deliver enterprise-grade functionality across all libraries (XSystem, XNode, XData, XSchema, XAction, XEntity) while maintaining rapid iteration and continuous improvement.

### **Versioning Philosophy:**
- **Version 0.x**: Experimental stage - Complete all libraries, backends, and frontends, implement at least 3 full-fledged applications
- **Version 1.x**: Production ready - Enterprise deployment and stability
- **Version 2.x**: Draft Mars Standard - Interoperability and standardization
- **Version 3.x**: RUST Core & Multi-language - Available in RUST, Python, TypeScript, and Go
- **Version 4.x**: Mars Standard Implementation - Full compliance across all platforms
