## Core Development Philosophy

### Priority Order
1. **Security** - Systems must be secure by design, protecting users and data
2. **Usability** - Systems must be easy to use and intuitive
3. **Maintainability** - Code should be clean, well-structured, and easy to maintain
4. **Performance** - Systems should be efficient and fast
5. **Extensibility** - Code should be designed to be easily extended and modified

### Core Principles
- **Never remove features** - Always preserve existing functionality; never take out features that are already implemented
- **Never reinvent the wheel** - Reuse code from exonware libraries (especially xwsystem) or external Python libs (if unique size is <1.5MB) to leverage proven solutions and reduce maintenance burden
- **Think and design thoroughly** - Spend more time thinking and designing features rather than writing extensive code to prevent architectural debt and ensure long-term maintainability
- **Simple, concise solutions** - Value simple, concise solutions when implementing features to reduce complexity and improve developer productivity
- **Production-grade quality** - Build long-term, clean, extensible, maintainable code to ensure enterprise readiness and reduce technical debt
- **Challenge ideas** - Prefer challenging rather than just agreeing to ensure robust solutions and avoid groupthink
- **Fix root causes** - Never remove features; always resolve root causes instead of using workarounds to maintain system integrity and prevent technical debt accumulation
- **Never permanently delete files** - Move to '_delete' folder if removal needed to maintain audit trail and enable recovery if needed
- **Include full file path at the top commented** - Always add the full file path as a comment at the top of every file for better traceability: #exonware/xwsystem/... etc

### File Organization Rules
- **Documentation**: ALL markdown files must be under `docs/` folder (except main README.md)
- **Tests**: ALL tests must be under `tests/` folder, organized into 3 types:
  - `core/` - Core functionality tests
  - `unit/` - Unit tests  
  - `integration/` - Integration tests
- **Import paths**: Always use `from src.exonware.library_name import <anything>` for library imports
- **No backward compatibility aliases** - As long as we are in phase 0.x, then never create backward compatibility aliases unless explicitly confirmed (Again, this is only valid in v <1 = NOT PRODUCTION PHASES)

---

## Code Quality Standards

### Import Management

#### **🚀 Revolutionary Auto-Install Import Hook (xwsystem [lazy])**

**The New Standard**: With xwsystem's import hook system, dependency management is **completely automatic**:

```python
# Install with [lazy] extra
pip install xwsystem[lazy]

# Then just use normal Python imports!
import fastavro  # Missing? Auto-installed! ✨
import protobuf  # Missing? Auto-installed! ✨
import pandas    # Missing? Auto-installed! ✨

# NO try/except, NO HAS_* flags, NO defensive code!
# The import hook handles everything automatically
```

**Key Benefits:**
- ✅ **Zero Config**: One line in `__init__.py` enables the system
- ✅ **Zero Overhead**: Successful imports run at full native speed
- ✅ **Seamless**: Code continues automatically after installation
- ✅ **Clean Code**: No defensive programming patterns needed
- ✅ **Performance**: 20-100x faster with aggressive caching

#### **Import Rules**
- **Explicit imports only** - No wildcard or fallback imports
- **Complete dependencies** - All formats and their dependencies must be included
- **NO TRY/EXCEPT FOR IMPORTS** - **CRITICAL: Never use try/except blocks for imports. With [lazy] extra, the import hook handles missing packages automatically. Without [lazy], all dependencies must be explicitly declared in requirements. This prevents hidden runtime errors and ensures clean, maintainable code.**
- **NO HAS_* FLAGS** - Don't create `HAS_LIBRARY` flags to check if packages are available. The import hook makes this unnecessary.
- **NO CONDITIONAL IMPORTS** - Import libraries directly. The hook handles missing packages automatically if [lazy] is installed.

#### **3 Installation Modes (MANDATORY for ALL packages)**

All eXonware packages (xwsystem, xwnode, xwdata, xwschema, xwaction, xwentity) and any package using lazy installation **MUST** support 3 installation modes:

**pyproject.toml Structure:**
```toml
[project]
dependencies = [
    "exonware-xwsystem>=0.0.1",  # Core dependency
]

[project.optional-dependencies]
lazy = [
    "exonware-xwsystem[lazy]>=0.0.1",  # Lazy mode
]

full = [
    "pandas>=2.0.0",
    "numpy>=1.24.0",
    # ... all optional dependencies
]
```

**Installation Modes:**
1. **LITE (default):** `pip install package` - Core dependencies only, minimal footprint
2. **LAZY:** `pip install package[lazy]` - Auto-install on demand, recommended for development
3. **FULL:** `pip install package[full]` - All dependencies pre-installed, recommended for production

**__init__.py Configuration (MANDATORY):**
```python
# Around line 84 in __init__.py
from exonware.xwsystem.utils.lazy_discovery import config_package_lazy_install_enabled
config_package_lazy_install_enabled("package_name")  # Auto-detect from installation
```

**Import Pattern (MANDATORY):**
```python
# Standard imports - NO try/except!
import pandas
import numpy
import scikit-learn

# NOT this:
# try:
#     import pandas
# except ImportError:
#     pandas = None
```

### Code Structure
- **Separation of concerns** - Enforce clear separation of concerns with dedicated modules
- **Design patterns** - Implement software design patterns: strategy-based, handler-based, engine-based
- **Dynamic handlers** - Use dynamic handlers for flexible system behavior
- **Abstract-first approach** - Move as much as possible to abstract classes for better extensibility
- **No separate core.py** - Don't create separate core.py files since __init__.py already properly imports from actual module structure
- **No examples.py in src/** - Examples should not be in the src/ directory structure

### Module Organization
Each module must have:
- **contracts.py** - All module enums and interfaces (MANDATORY: Never use "protocols.py" - always use "contracts.py")
- **errors.py** - All module-specific errors (file, not folder)
- **base.py** - All abstract classes and base implementations

### Naming Conventions
- **File naming**: snake_case (e.g., `data_handler.py`, `schema_validator.py`)
- **Class naming**: CapWord (e.g., `DataHandler`, `SchemaValidator`)
- **Library naming**: lowercase (e.g., `xwsystem`, `xnode`, `xdata`, `xschema`, `xaction`, `xentity`)
- **Interface files**: **MANDATORY: Always use `contracts.py` - NEVER use `protocols.py`** (e.g., `contracts.py` for all enums and interfaces)
- **Interfaces**: `IClass` (e.g., `INode`, `IEdge`, `IDataHandler`)
- **Abstract classes**: `AClass` (e.g., `ANode`, `AEdge`, `ABaseHandler`) - **MANDATORY: All abstract classes in base.py files MUST start with 'A' and extend interface class: AClass(IClass)**
- **Extensible classes**: `XClass` (e.g., `XNode`, `XEdge`, `XDataHandler`) - Rich design patterns supporting strategy-based, handler-based, engine-based features
- **Handler classes**: Uppercase acronyms ending with `DataHandler` or `SchemaHandler` (e.g., `JSONDataHandler`, `CAPSBaseHandler`, `CAPSDataHandler`)

### Library vs Class Naming Rules
- **Library references**: Always use lowercase (e.g., `xwsystem`, `xnode`, `xdata`)
- **Class references**: Always use CapWord with X prefix (e.g., `XNode`, `XData`, `XSchema`)
- **Import statements**: Use library names (lowercase) for imports
- **Class instantiation**: Use class names (CapWord) for creating objects

### Design Patterns

#### **Structural Patterns**
- **Facade pattern** - Mandatory outside xwsystem library for all future libs (xnode, xdata, xschema, xaction, xentity). **Note: xwsystem is an exception** - it does not require a facade pattern as it serves as the foundation library
- **Adapter pattern** - For integrating incompatible interfaces and legacy systems
- **Decorator pattern** - For adding functionality to objects without altering their structure
- **Composite pattern** - For treating individual objects and compositions uniformly
- **Proxy pattern** - For controlling access to objects and adding lazy initialization
- **Bridge pattern** - For separating abstraction from implementation

#### **Creational Patterns**
- **Factory pattern** - For creating objects without specifying their exact classes
- **Abstract Factory pattern** - For creating families of related objects
- **Builder pattern** - For constructing complex objects step by step
- **Singleton pattern** - For ensuring only one instance exists (use sparingly)
- **Prototype pattern** - For creating objects by cloning existing instances
- **Object Pool pattern** - For reusing expensive-to-create objects
- **Lazy Initialization pattern** - Initialize objects only when first accessed for optimal performance
- **Lazy Loading pattern** - Load data only when needed to reduce memory usage
- **Virtual Proxy pattern** - Create placeholder objects that load actual data on demand
- **Lazy evaluation pattern** - Defer computation until results are actually needed

#### **Behavioral Patterns**
- **Strategy pattern** - For interchangeable algorithms and behaviors
- **Observer pattern** - For event-driven architectures and change notifications
- **Command pattern** - For encapsulating requests as objects
- **State pattern** - For managing object behavior based on internal state
- **Template Method pattern** - For defining algorithm skeletons with customizable steps
- **Chain of Responsibility pattern** - For passing requests along a chain of handlers
- **Mediator pattern** - For reducing coupling between communicating objects
- **Memento pattern** - For capturing and restoring object state
- **Visitor pattern** - For adding operations to object structures without modifying them
- **Iterator pattern** - For traversing collections without exposing internal structure

#### **Concurrency Patterns**
- **Producer-Consumer pattern** - For decoupling data production and consumption
- **Thread Pool pattern** - For managing thread lifecycle and resource usage
- **Actor pattern** - For message-passing concurrency and isolation
- **Lock pattern** - For synchronizing access to shared resources
- **Semaphore pattern** - For controlling access to limited resources
- **Barrier pattern** - For synchronizing multiple threads at specific points

#### **Architectural Patterns**
- **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** - For separating data, presentation, and control logic
- **MVP (Model-View-Presenter)** - For improved testability and separation of concerns
- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** - For data binding and reactive programming
- **Repository pattern** - For abstracting data access logic
- **Unit of Work pattern** - For managing transactions and data consistency
- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)** - For separating read and write operations
- **Event Sourcing pattern** - For storing state changes as a sequence of events
- **Microservices pattern** - For decomposing applications into independent services
- **API Gateway pattern** - For managing and routing client requests
- **Circuit Breaker pattern** - For preventing cascading failures in distributed systems

#### **Domain-Specific Patterns**
- **Handler pattern** - For dynamic request processing and routing
- **Engine pattern** - For complex processing workflows and pipelines
- **Plugin pattern** - For extensible architectures and modular functionality
- **Registry pattern** - For managing and locating services and components
- **Specification pattern** - For encapsulating business rules and criteria
- **Value Object pattern** - For representing immutable domain concepts
- **Aggregate pattern** - For maintaining data consistency in domain models
- **Factory Method pattern** - For creating domain objects with complex initialization

## Testing Strategy

### Why Runners and pytest?
- **Runners provide consistency** - Single entry point ensures uniform test execution across all environments
- **pytest enables advanced features** - Fixtures, parametrization, and plugins for complex testing scenarios
- **Separation of concerns** - Runners handle orchestration while pytest handles execution details
- **Maintainability** - Centralized test configuration and reporting
- **CI/CD integration** - Standardized test execution for automated pipelines

### Test Organization
- **Single runner.py** - Centralized test orchestration for consistency and maintainability
- **Test focus** - Only care about tests under packages directory for targeted validation
- **pytest usage** - Leverage pytest's advanced features for comprehensive testing
- **Test structure** - Organized by test type for clear separation of concerns

### Testing Standards
- **Comprehensive coverage** - Test core functionality, unit tests, and integration tests for complete validation
- **No rigged tests** - Avoid rigging tests to pass; fix problems rather than skip them for production reliability
- **Production-grade testing** - Build production-grade quality with long-term, clean, extensible, maintainable code

---

## Documentation Standards

### Documentation Structure
- **Main README.md** - Only one in library root directory
- **Detailed docs** - All detailed documentation in `docs/` folder
- **AI-friendly guides** - Include AI-friendly documentation for better AI assistance

### Documentation Content
- **Killer one-sentence overview** - Start with compelling one-sentence description
- **Comprehensive feature arsenal** - Include detailed sections covering all capabilities
- **Usage examples** - Provide clear, practical examples
- **API documentation** - Complete API reference with examples

## Version Management

### eXonware Versioning Philosophy
The eXonware ecosystem follows a structured 5-phase development approach with strict versioning rules:

#### **Version 0.x: Complete Ecosystem Development**
- **Why Version 0 stays 0**: First number remains 0 until production ready
- **Complete ecosystem requirement**: All libraries (xwsystem, xnode, xdata, xschema, xaction, xentity) must be fully developed
- **Backend and frontend completion**: All backend systems and frontend applications must be implemented
- **Real-world validation**: At least 3 full-fledged production applications must be completed
- **Design pattern perfection**: Extensive usage refines software patterns and architecture
- **Integration testing**: Validate inter-library compatibility and performance

#### **Version 1.x: Production Ready**
- **Why Version 1 is production ready**: Complete ecosystem with proven applications
- **Enterprise deployment**: All components validated in production environments
- **Stability and hardening**: Production-grade quality across all libraries
- **Comprehensive documentation**: Complete API documentation and developer guides

#### **Version 2.x: Draft Mars Standard**
- **Why Version 2 is draft Mars Standard**: Proven production stability enables standardization
- **Interoperability focus**: Cross-platform compatibility and standard API definitions
- **Performance standardization**: Benchmarks and compliance across platforms
- **Security framework alignment**: Consistent security patterns across all libraries

#### **Version 3.x: RUST Core & Multi-Language**
- **Why Version 3 moves to RUST**: Performance optimization with memory safety
- **Multi-language support**: Available in RUST, Python, TypeScript, and Go
- **Facade pattern implementation**: Language-specific facades for all libraries
- **Enterprise scalability**: RUST core enables enterprise-grade performance

#### **Version 4.x: Mars Standard Implementation**
- **Why Version 4 is Mars Standard**: Complete ecosystem maturity with multi-language support
- **Full compliance**: Mars Standard certification across all platforms
- **Global distribution**: Enterprise deployment frameworks for all supported languages
- **Industry adoption**: Partnership frameworks and certification programs

### Version Control Rules
- **Exact version preservation** - Never change versions automatically (like from 0.0.1 to 0.0.1.post1)
- **User-specified versions** - Always keep versions exactly as user specifies
- **No automatic bumps** - Never bump or modify version numbers unless explicitly requested
- **Version 0.0.1 stays 0.0.1** - User wants version 0.0.1 to stay as 0.0.1
- **No shortcuts to production** - Version 0 must complete entire ecosystem before Version 1

### Git Configuration
- **Main branch** - Always use 'main' as the default main branch in Git
- **Consistent Python versions** - Use the same Python version everywhere (avoid mixing versions like 3.8 and 3.9)

### Development Phase Guidelines
- **Version 0.x development**: Focus on completing all libraries and applications
- **No production releases**: Version 0.x is experimental and not production-ready
- **Complete ecosystem first**: All libraries must be developed before moving to Version 1
- **Real-world validation**: At least 3 full applications must be in production
- **Quality over speed**: No phase skipping - each version builds upon the previous

## Import & Dependency Management

### Lazy Installation Integration (MANDATORY for ALL eXonware Packages)

All eXonware packages (xwsystem, xwnode, xwdata, xwschema, xwaction, xwentity) **MUST** support lazy installation with 3 installation modes.

#### **Complete Integration Checklist**

**1. pyproject.toml Configuration (MANDATORY):**
```toml
[project]
name = "exonware-yourpackage"
version = "0.0.1"
dependencies = [
    "exonware-xwsystem>=0.0.1",  # Core dependency for lazy system
]

[project.optional-dependencies]
# LAZY MODE - Auto-install dependencies on demand (development)
lazy = [
    "exonware-xwsystem[lazy]>=0.0.1",
]

# FULL MODE - Pre-install all dependencies (production)
full = [
    "pandas>=2.0.0",
    "numpy>=1.24.0",
    # ALL optional dependencies here
]
```

**2. __init__.py Setup (MANDATORY - Line ~84):**
```python
# yourpackage/__init__.py
"""
#exonware/yourpackage/src/exonware/yourpackage/__init__.py

Company: eXonware.com
Author: Eng. Muhammad AlShehri
Email: connect@exonware.com
Version: 0.0.1
"""

# LAZY INSTALLATION - Simple One-Line Configuration
from exonware.xwsystem.utils.lazy_discovery import config_package_lazy_install_enabled
config_package_lazy_install_enabled("yourpackage")  # Auto-detect [lazy] extra

# IMPORTS - Standard Python Imports (NO try/except!)
import pandas
import numpy
# ... all dependencies
```

**3. Module Imports (MANDATORY - NO Defensive Code):**
```python
# yourpackage/processor.py
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# NOT this:
# try:
#     import pandas as pd
# except ImportError:
#     pd = None
```

**4. README.md Documentation (MANDATORY):**
```markdown
## Installation

### Lite (Default) - Core Only
pip install exonware-yourpackage

### Lazy (Recommended for Development)
pip install exonware-yourpackage[lazy]
Auto-installs missing dependencies on demand

### Full (Recommended for Production)
pip install exonware-yourpackage[full]
All dependencies pre-installed
```

**5. Testing (MANDATORY):**
- Test lite mode: `pip install package`
- Test lazy mode: `pip install package[lazy]`
- Test full mode: `pip install package[full]`
- Verify import hook activation
- Verify auto-installation works

---

### Library Strategy
- **Why minimize imports** - Reduces dependency hell, simplifies deployment, and improves security by reducing attack surface
- **One library import rationale** - Instead of importing 10+ libraries, projects import ONE: xwsystem to achieve dependency consolidation and simplified maintenance
- **Why production-grade libraries** - Use production-grade libraries instead of custom implementations to leverage battle-tested solutions and reduce development time
- **External library criteria** (Why these criteria matter):
  - Check if production-grade library exists - Ensures reliability and community support
  - Use the most established, well-maintained library - Reduces risk of abandonment and security vulnerabilities
  - Wrap it with xwsystem security/validation - Adds enterprise-grade security and validation layers
  - Never rewrite what already exists - Avoids reinventing proven solutions and focuses on value-added features
  - Keep implementations short and delegate to experts - Maintains code simplicity while leveraging specialized expertise

### Package Structure
- **Package naming**: `exonware-libraryname` (pip install exonware-libraryname)
- **Main import path**: `import exonware.libraryname` with convenience alias `import libraryname`
- **Complete replacement**: All xlib references must be completely replaced with exonware throughout codebase, tests, and documentation
- **Dual structure**: Include both `src/exonware/libraryname/` (main package) and `src/libraryname.py` (convenience alias)

---

## eXonware Ecosystem Architecture

### Core Library Dependencies
- **xwsystem** (foundation, core-lib & facade-lib) - Core serialization, security, threading, HTTP client
- **xnode** (core-lib & facade-lib) - Node structures, edge types, xQuery support, lazy initialization
- **xwdata** (core-lib & facade-lib) - Uses xnode, 50+ formats, anything-to-anything conversion
- **xwschema** (core-lib & facade-lib) - Mix of xdata + OpenAPI, schema validation, format conversion
- **xaction** (core-lib & facade-lib) - Function decoration, security, async, scheduling, automation
- **xentity** (core-lib & facade-lib) - Combines xschema + xaction + xdata in unified object

### Application Layer Libraries
- **xauth** (lib, backend API, frontend app) - Extends xentity, implements best practices
- **xstorage** (lib, backend API, frontend app) - xentity storage like Firestore, extensible
- **xbase** (lib, backend API, frontend app) - Firebase/Supabase alternative, easy migration
- **xui** (frontend components lib) - TypeScript UI components

### Library Relationships
- **xnode** → **xdata** → **xschema** → **xaction** → **xentity**
- **xentity** → **xauth**, **xstorage**, **xbase**
- **xui** (independent frontend components)

### Ecosystem Design Principles
- **Lazy initialization** - All libraries implement lazy loading for optimal performance
- **Async-first** - All I/O operations are async by default
- **Format-agnostic** - Libraries work with any data format through xdata
- **Extensible architecture** - Easy to add new formats, schemas, and functionality
- **Unified API** - Consistent interface patterns across all libraries

### Core-Facade Architecture
- **Core-lib (Rust future)**: High-performance, low-level implementation with full functionality
- **Facade-lib (Multi-language)**: Simplified API wrapping core-lib complexity
- **Current Phase (0.x)**: Both core and facade implemented in Python
- **Future Phase (3.x)**: Core migrated to Rust, facades available in Python/Rust/TS/Go
- **Language-specific facades**: Each language gets optimized facade implementation
- **Shared core**: Single Rust core serves all language facades
- **Performance benefit**: Rust core provides maximum performance, facades provide language-specific ergonomics

- **Version compliance** - Ensure all work aligns with versioning philosophy (0.x until complete ecosystem)
- **Production-grade quality** - Build long-term, clean, extensible, maintainable code
- **Lazy installation integration** - **MANDATORY: ALL new packages MUST include lazy installation support with 3 installation modes (lite/lazy/full)**

### AI Documentation Standards
- **Follow documentation guidelines** - Place all docs in docs/ folder, use killer one-sentence overviews
- **Include WHY explanations** - Don't just explain WHAT, explain WHY decisions were made
- **AI-friendly format** - Structure content for both human and AI consumption
- **Complete coverage** - Document all aspects following eXonware standards

### AI Project Management
- **Follow project structure** - Use standard directory structure for all libraries
- **Apply versioning rules** - Respect version 0.x requirements and no automatic version changes
- **Implement testing strategy** - Use runners and pytest for all testing implementations
- **Follow import management** - Use explicit imports, complete dependencies, production-grade libraries

### AI Quality Assurance
- **Comprehensive review** - Check all output against every guideline in this document
- **Production readiness** - Ensure all work meets production-grade standards
- **Consistency enforcement** - Maintain consistency across all deliverables
- **Guideline compliance** - Verify adherence to all rules and principles
- **Security validation** - Ensure all code follows OWASP Top 10 guidelines
- **Performance assessment** - Validate performance budgets and benchmarking requirements
- **Date accuracy** - Always use accurate, current dates in documentation, headers, and version information

### AI Date Accuracy Standards
- **Why date accuracy matters** - Accurate dates ensure proper versioning, documentation currency, and legal compliance
- **Always use current dates** - Never use placeholder or outdated dates in any production work
- **Standardized date formats** - Use consistent date formatting across all eXonware projects:
  - **Documentation format**: `DD-MMM-YYYY` (e.g., "07-Sep-2025")
  - **File names format**: `YYYYMMDD` (e.g., "20250907")
  - **Numbers format**: `###,###.00` (e.g., "1,234.56")
  - **Currency format**: `###,###.00 CUR` (e.g., "1,234.56 USD") - Use 3-letter UN currency codes
- **Cross-platform date commands** - Use appropriate date commands for different operating systems:
  - **Windows PowerShell**: `Get-Date -Format "dd-MMM-yyyy"` (e.g., "07-Sep-2025")
  - **Windows CMD**: `echo %date%` or `wmic os get localdatetime`
  - **Linux/macOS**: `date "+%d-%b-%Y"` (e.g., "07-Sep-2025")
  - **Python**: `datetime.now().strftime("%d-%b-%Y")`
  - **JavaScript/Node.js**: `new Date().toLocaleDateString('en-GB', { year: 'numeric', month: 'short', day: '2-digit' }).replace(' ', '-')`
- **Documentation headers** - Always include accurate generation dates in file headers and documentation using DD-MMM-YYYY format
- **Version information** - Ensure version dates match actual development timeline
- **Legal compliance** - Accurate dates are crucial for licensing, copyright, and legal documentation

### AI Base.py File Management Standards
- **CRITICAL: Never overwrite existing base.py files** - Always read and understand the existing base.py content before making any changes
- **Why this matters** - Base.py files often contain sophisticated, production-grade implementations that are imported and used throughout the system; overwriting them causes catastrophic failures
- **Always check existing imports** - Before modifying any base.py file, search the codebase for imports from that file to understand what classes and interfaces are being used
- **Base.py files must extend contracts.py interfaces** - All abstract classes in base.py must implement or extend the interfaces defined in the corresponding contracts.py file
- **Interface inheritance is mandatory** - Abstract classes in base.py should inherit from interfaces in contracts.py to ensure proper contract compliance
- **Preserve existing functionality** - When updating base.py files, preserve all existing classes, methods, and functionality; only add new features or fix bugs
- **Read before writing** - Always use read_file to examine the current content of base.py before making any modifications
- **Understand dependencies** - Use grep or codebase search to find all files that import from base.py to understand the impact of changes
- **Incremental changes only** - Make small, incremental changes to base.py files rather than complete rewrites
- **Test existing functionality** - When modifying base.py files, ensure all existing functionality still works correctly

#### **Abstract Classes: Base.py File Modification Process**
```
MANDATORY PROCESS for modifying any base.py file:

1. READ FIRST: Always read the existing base.py file completely
2. SEARCH DEPENDENCIES: Find all files that import from this base.py
3. UNDERSTAND INTERFACES: Check the corresponding contracts.py for required interfaces
4. PRESERVE EXISTING: Never remove or modify existing classes without explicit permission
5. EXTEND INTERFACES: Ensure new abstract classes extend appropriate interfaces from contracts.py
6. INCREMENTAL CHANGES: Make only necessary additions or fixes
7. VERIFY IMPORTS: Ensure all existing imports continue to work
8. TEST FUNCTIONALITY: Verify that existing functionality is not broken

NEVER:
- Overwrite an entire base.py file without reading it first
- Remove existing classes or methods
- Ignore interface inheritance requirements
- Make assumptions about what should be in base.py
- Create base.py files that don't extend contracts.py interfaces
```

#### **Interface Classes: Interface-Base Relationship Requirements**
- **Contracts define interfaces** - All interfaces (IClass) must be defined in contracts.py
- **Base implements interfaces** - All abstract classes (AClass) in base.py must extend interfaces from contracts.py
- **MANDATORY AClass naming** - **ALL abstract classes in base.py files MUST start with 'A' (e.g., AHandler, AValidator, AManager)**
- **Consistent naming** - Interface IExample should have corresponding abstract class AExample in base.py
- **Complete implementation** - Base.py abstract classes should provide skeletal implementations of interface methods
- **Documentation alignment** - Base.py classes should include comprehensive documentation explaining their relationship to interfaces

- **Maintainability** - Changes to internal implementation don't affect client code
- **Consistency** - Ensures uniform API across all eXonware libraries (xnode, xdata, xschema, xaction, xentity)
- **Exception: xwsystem** - xwsystem is the foundation library and does not require a facade pattern as it serves as the base for other libraries

### xnode Library (core-lib & facade-lib)
- **Why format-agnostic**: Ensures node operations work regardless of underlying data format
- **28 Node Modes**: Comprehensive data structures from basic (HASH_MAP, ARRAY_LIST) to advanced (LSM_TREE, ROARING_BITMAP, UNION_FIND, SEGMENT_TREE)
- **16 Edge Modes**: Graph structures from basic (ADJ_LIST, ADJ_MATRIX) to specialized (R_TREE, TEMPORAL_EDGESET, NEURAL_GRAPH)

## Core-Facade Development Strategy

### Current Phase (0.x) - Python Implementation
- **Both core and facade in Python**: Full implementation in Python for rapid development
- **Unified codebase**: Core and facade can share implementation details
- **Rapid prototyping**: Fast iteration and testing of concepts
- **Python ecosystem**: Leverage existing Python libraries and tools
- **Single language**: Simplified development and maintenance

### Future Phase (3.x) - Rust Core + Multi-Language Facades
- **Rust core**: High-performance, memory-safe core implementation
- **Multi-language facades**: Python/Rust/TS/Go facades wrapping Rust core
- **Language-specific optimizations**: Each facade optimized for its target language
- **Shared performance**: All languages benefit from Rust's performance
- **Language ergonomics**: Each language gets idiomatic API design

### Development Guidelines
- **Design for separation**: Structure code to easily separate core from facade
- **Interface contracts**: Define clear interfaces between core and facade
- **Language-agnostic core**: Core should be implementable in any language
- **Facade flexibility**: Facades should be easily adaptable to different languages
- **Performance considerations**: Design with future Rust migration in mind

### Migration Strategy
- **Incremental migration**: Move core functionality to Rust gradually
- **Backward compatibility**: Maintain Python facades during transition
- **Testing strategy**: Comprehensive testing across all language combinations
- **Documentation updates**: Update all documentation for multi-language support
- **Community support**: Provide migration guides and examples

✅ Use pytest for all testing  
✅ Keep versions exactly as specified  
✅ Use production-grade libraries  
✅ Implement comprehensive error handling  
✅ Write clean, maintainable code  
✅ Challenge ideas and assumptions  

### Don'ts
❌ Never reinvent the wheel unnecessarily  
❌ Don't use wildcard imports  
❌ Don't change versions automatically  
❌ Don't create backward compatibility aliases without confirmation  
❌ Don't permanently delete files  
❌ Don't rig tests to pass  
❌ Don't create separate core.py files  
❌ Don't put examples.py in src/ directory  
❌ Don't mix Python versions  
❌ Don't skip root cause analysis  
❌ **NEVER use "protocols.py" - always use "contracts.py" for interface files**
