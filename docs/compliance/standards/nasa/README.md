# NASA Standards Compliance

**Scope:** Software safety, engineering, assurance, and risk management for aerospace-grade systems.  
**Applicability:** All core libraries (xwsystem, xwnode, xwdata, xschema, xaction, xentity) and any backend service targeting Mars Standard v2+.  
**Priority:** High (required for v2 draft, full compliance by v4).  
**Last status review:** 08-Nov-2025 00:00 UTC � ? Not compliant (structure only; no evidence recorded).

## Gap Analysis

The 08-Nov-2025 review confirmed that no NASA compliance artefacts have been produced yet. Key gaps:

| Gap | Impacted Requirements | Current Status | Planned Actions |
|-----|-----------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Formal verification missing | NASA-8739.8-RQ-002, NASA-8739.8-RQ-001 | 0% implementation | Execute Phase 1 formal verification roadmap (tooling + component proofs) |
| No automated requirements traceability | NASA-NPR-7150.2D-RQ-001 | 0% | Design and implement requirements?code?test trace pipeline |
| Safety case documentation absent | NASA-8719.13-RQ-001/002 | 0% | Develop hazard analysis and safety case artifacts |
| Advanced static analysis limited | NASA-8739.8-RQ-001 | 60% | Extend rules and coverage in CI (Phase 2 of action plan) |
| V&V plan incomplete | NASA-8739.8-RQ-001 | 40% | Produce master V&V plan and evidence catalogue (Phase 2) |

### Action Items (v2)
1. Consolidate formal verification roadmap into `verification/vv_plan.md`; schedule proof coverage for MemoryMonitor, CryptoManager, AtomicFile, PathValidator, DataValidator, TypeSafety components.  
2. Prototype traceability automation (requirements ? code ? tests) and document workflow in `mars_standard/README.md`.  
3. Draft safety case template referencing NASA-STD-8719.13 and link to risk register entries.  
4. Extend static-analysis coverage and integrate results into CI dashboards.  
5. Capture risk, safety, and V&V evidence under `docs/compliance/evidence/nasa/` as artefacts become available.

## Integration Points

- **Architecture:** Safety-critical modules flagged via GUIDE_ARCH action items; risk mitigation recorded in ADRs.  
- **Development:** GUIDE_DEV enforces error handling, root-cause fixes, and testing hierarchy aligning with NASA practices.  
- **Testing:** Extend `tests/compliance/` with NASA-specific suites; integrate with advance layer gating.  
- **Documentation:** Compliance findings linked in `GUIDE_COMP.md` and release CHANGE/PROJECT documents.

---

## Evidence

- Evidence repository: `docs/compliance/evidence/nasa/` (create folders per requirement as artefacts are generated).

---

## Notes

- Applicable from v2 onwards; monitor NASA standards/NPR revisions.  
- Coordinate with ECSS and DO-178C packages to avoid duplicated remediation work.  
- Document deviations or waivers with Architecture Board approval.
