# ISO/IEC 27002 � Security Controls

Support package for ISO/IEC 27001 implementation. Provides the detailed control catalogue (Annex A).

---

## Control Domains (summary)

1. Organisational controls  
2. People controls  
3. Physical controls  
4. Technological controls

---

## Implementation Approach

- Map each control to existing processes (e.g., secure development lifecycle, access management, logging).  
- Identify gaps requiring new policies or tooling.  
- Document compensating controls where full implementation is not feasible.  
- Link control implementation to NIST SP 800-53 where overlaps exist.

---

## Action Items

- Produce control-to-owner matrix (planned).  
- Integrate with security architecture reviews.  
- Store evidence (policies, procedures, logs) under `docs/compliance/evidence/iso/27002/`.

Status tracking will commence once owners are assigned (target: v2).
