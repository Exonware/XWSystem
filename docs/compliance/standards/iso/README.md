# ISO / IEC Compliance Overview

This directory groups ISO/IEC standards relevant to security, privacy, quality, and life-cycle management. Compliance becomes mandatory from Version 2.x onwards as part of Mars Standard.

## Subdirectories

- `27001/` � Information Security Management System (ISMS).  
- `27002/` � Security control catalogue supporting 27001 implementation.  
- `27017_27018/` � Cloud security (27017) and cloud privacy (27018).  
- `9001/` � Quality management system (recommended for v3/v4).  
- `lifecycle/` � Software/system life-cycle standards (12207, 15288) and process capability (15504/330xx).

Each subfolder must include:
1. Scope and applicability statement (marking mandatory version).  
2. Requirements register with owners and implementation targets.  
3. Gap analysis and planned remediation.  
4. Integration notes (architecture, development, testing).  
5. Evidence links (risk assessments, audits, policies).

Existing ISO references (e.g., ISO 8601, ISO/IEC 39075) remain documented in product-specific references but should be cross-linked here when relevant to compliance.
