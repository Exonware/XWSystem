# ISO 9001 � Quality Management System

**Applicability:** Recommended for v3+ to reinforce continuous improvement and customer assurance.  
**Objective:** Implement a quality management system (QMS) aligned with ISO 9001:2015.

## Initial Steps

- Define QMS scope (products, services, supporting processes).  
- Document quality policy and objectives.  
- Map processes (development, testing, release, support) to QMS requirements.  
- Establish CAPA (Corrective and Preventive Action) workflow linked to CHANGE/PROJECT docs.  
- Plan internal quality audits.

---

## Dependencies

- Builds on ISO/IEC 27001 risk assessments and DO-178C quality processes.  
- Requires collaboration between engineering, product, and customer success teams.

Status: Planned for v3. No deliverables yet. Update this README once QMS initiative launches.
