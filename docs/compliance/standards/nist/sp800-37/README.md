# NIST SP 800-37 � Risk Management Framework (RMF)

**Applicability:** Enterprise risk management for information systems (mandatory starting v2).  
**Purpose:** Provide structured steps for categorisation, selection, implementation, assessment, authorisation, and monitoring of security controls.

---

## Planned Workflow

1. **Categorise** systems and services (link to risk register).  
2. **Select** controls (map to SP 800-53 / ISO/IEC 27002).  
3. **Implement** controls (record in GUIDE_DEV, architecture ADRs, CI pipelines).  
4. **Assess** effectiveness (tests, audits).  
5. **Authorise** (management sign-off).  
6. **Monitor** continuously (metrics, alerts, periodic reviews).

## Action Items

- Define RMF roles and responsibilities.  
- Document categorisation for each library/service.  
- Align monitoring cadence with compliance reviews.  
- Store artefacts under `docs/compliance/evidence/nist/sp800-37/`.

Status: To be initiated during v2 planning.
