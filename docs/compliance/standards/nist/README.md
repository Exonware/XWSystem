# NIST SP 800 Series Compliance

This package covers the NIST Special Publication 800 family of controls and guidance adopted as part of the Mars Standard.

## Subdirectories

- `sp800-53/` � Security and privacy controls for information systems.  
- `sp800-63/` � Digital identity guidelines.  
- `sp800-160/` � Systems security engineering.  
- `sp800-37/` � Risk management framework.

Each subdirectory requires:
- Requirements register (mapped to owners and systems).  
- Gap analysis & remediation plan.  
- Integration notes with ISO/IEC 27001 controls and GUIDE_DEV security practices.  
- Evidence references (policies, test reports, tooling outputs).

Adoption begins in v2; ensure overlaps with ISO/IEC controls are documented to avoid redundant work.
