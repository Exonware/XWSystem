# NIST SP 800-160 � Systems Security Engineering

**Applicability:** Architecture and engineering lifecycle (v2 onwards).  
**Goal:** Embed security engineering principles throughout system development.

---

## Key Activities

- Integrate security considerations into requirements, architecture, implementation, and verification.  
- Maintain security architecture documentation and threat models.  
- Align with GUIDE_ARCH priorities (security first) and GUIDE_DEV practices.  
- Support continuous risk management (linked to SP 800-37 and ISO/IEC 27001).

---

## Action Items

- Produce security engineering plan referencing SP 800-160 processes.  
- Update ADR templates to capture security engineering rationale.  
- Store evidence (threat models, security reviews) under `docs/compliance/evidence/nist/sp800-160/`.

Status: In planning. Kick-off with architecture team ahead of v2 milestone.
