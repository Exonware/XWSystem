# NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF 1.0)

**Applicability:** All AI capabilities (model training, inference, agent loops) from v2 onwards.  
**Goal:** Manage AI risks across the RMF functions � Govern, Map, Measure, and Manage.

---

## Tasks

- Define AI risk governance structure (roles, responsibilities, policies).  
- Map AI systems (context, purpose, intended users) and document assumptions.  
- Measure risks (accuracy, bias, robustness, security) using quantifiable metrics.  
- Manage risks through mitigation plans, monitoring, and incident response.

---

## Deliverables

- AI governance policy and procedures.  
- Risk assessment templates and completed assessments.  
- Model evaluation reports (linked to GUIDE_COMP evidence).  
- Monitoring dashboards / logs for ongoing oversight.
