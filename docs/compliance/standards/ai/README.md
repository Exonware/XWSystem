# AI Governance Standards

Compliance packages for AI and ML capabilities introduced in eXonware solutions (agents, models, retrieval, analytics). Mandatory from v2 onwards for any AI feature.

## Subdirectories

- `nist_rmf/` � NIST AI Risk Management Framework 1.0  
- `iso_23894/` � AI risk management guidelines  
- `iso_42001/` � AI management system requirements  
- `eu_ai_act/` � EU AI Act (draft 2024) documentation and readiness

Each folder should cover:
- Risk classification and assessment templates  
- Policies/procedures (data governance, model lifecycle, human oversight)  
- Evaluation metrics (robustness, fairness, transparency)  
- Evidence (model cards, validation reports, incident logs)

Coordinate work with data, product, and compliance teams to ensure AI operations respect overall security, privacy, and ethical commitments.
