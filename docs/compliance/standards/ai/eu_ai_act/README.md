## Steps

1. **System Classification:** Determine risk category (unacceptable, high-risk, limited, minimal).  
2. **Requirements Mapping:** For high-risk systems, ensure compliance with governance, data, technical documentation, transparency, human oversight, and robustness requirements.  
3. **Conformity Assessment:** Plan internal/external assessments as regulation finalises.  
4. **Post-market Monitoring:** Define incident reporting and monitoring processes.
