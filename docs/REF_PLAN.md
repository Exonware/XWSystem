## Planning Philosophy

### Core Principles

**Planning is thinking made visible.**

1. **Plans are living documents** - Update plans as understanding evolves
2. **Plans are communication tools** - For humans AND AI agents
3. **Plans prevent chaos** - Clear roadmaps reduce errors and rework
4. **Plans enable learning** - Document what worked and what didn't
5. **Plans respect eXonware priorities** - Security, Usability, Maintainability, Performance, Extensibility

### Why We Plan

**Without Planning:**
- ? Scope creep and mission drift
- ? Missed requirements and edge cases
- ? Inconsistent quality across features
- ? No clear success criteria
- ? Wasted effort on wrong solutions

**With Planning:**
- ? Clear objectives and success criteria
- ? Structured approach following standards
- ? Reduced errors through thinking first
- ? Better collaboration (human + AI)
- ? Knowledge transfer and continuity

### eXonware Planning Priorities

**Apply the 5 Priorities to ALL plans:**

1. **Security** - Does the plan address security implications?
2. **Usability** - Will the result be intuitive and user-friendly?
3. **Maintainability** - Is the approach clean and sustainable?
4. **Performance** - Have we considered performance impacts?
5. **Extensibility** - Can the solution be extended later?

---

## When to Create a Plan

### ? Always Create a Plan For:

1. **New Features** - Any significant functionality addition
2. **Refactoring** - Structural code improvements
3. **Bug Fixes (Complex)** - Multi-file or architectural bugs
4. **Testing Initiatives** - New test suites or testing strategies
5. **Documentation Projects** - Major doc updates or restructures
6. **Performance Optimization** - Benchmarking and optimization efforts
7. **Project Milestones** - Major deliverables or releases
8. **Integration Work** - Adding external dependencies or APIs
9. **Architecture Changes** - Design pattern modifications
10. **Migration Tasks** - Version upgrades or API changes

### ?? Consider a Plan For:

1. **Minor Features** - Small additions with dependencies
2. **Bug Fixes (Moderate)** - Bugs affecting multiple components
3. **Configuration Changes** - Non-trivial config updates
4. **Dependency Updates** - Package upgrades with breaking changes

### ? No Plan Needed For:

1. **Trivial Fixes** - Single-line bug fixes
2. **Documentation Typos** - Simple text corrections
3. **Code Formatting** - Pure style updates
4. **Comment Updates** - Adding/fixing inline comments

## Naming Conventions

### Plan Files

**Format:** `PLAN_YYYYMMDD_HHMM_DESCRIPTION.md`

**Rules:**
- All plan files go in `docs/plans/` directory
- Use same naming pattern as PROJECT documents
- YYYYMMDD = Date (e.g., 20251106)
- HHMM = 24-hour time (e.g., 1430)
- DESCRIPTION = Brief snake_case description
- Maximum 50 characters for full filename

**Examples:**
```
? PLAN_20251106_1700_IMPLEMENT_ASYNC_SERIALIZATION.md
? PLAN_20251107_0900_REFACTOR_CODEC_REGISTRY.md
? PLAN_20251108_1400_CREATE_API_REFERENCE_DOCS.md
? PLAN_20251109_1000_BENCHMARK_PERFORMANCE_SUITE.md

? plan_async.md (wrong format)
? async_plan.md (wrong format)
? PLAN_ASYNC_SERIALIZATION.md (missing date/time)
```

### Plan Status Updates

**In Plan Filename:**
- Keep original filename unchanged
- Update status field inside document

**Status Values:**
- 🔵 **Planned** - Not started yet
- 🟢 **In Progress** - Currently being executed
- ? **Complete** - Successfully finished
- ⏸️ **Paused** - Temporarily on hold
- ? **Cancelled** - Abandoned/no longer needed

---

## AI-Friendly Plan Patterns

### Structure Principles

**Make plans easy for AI agents to parse and execute:**

1. **Use Consistent Markdown Hierarchy**
   - `#` for title
   - `##` for major sections
   - `###` for subsections
   - `####` for details

2. **Use Checkboxes Extensively**
   - `- [ ]` for pending tasks
   - `- [x]` for completed tasks
   - Enables progress tracking

3. **Provide Explicit Context**
   - Don't assume knowledge
   - Link to relevant docs
   - Explain abbreviations
   - Define technical terms

4. **Use Structured Data**
   - Tables for comparisons
   - Lists for sequences
   - Code blocks for examples
   - Clear labels and headers

5. **Specify Success Criteria Clearly**
   - Measurable outcomes
   - Verifiable conditions
   - No ambiguity

### Clarity Guidelines

**Write for clarity, not brevity:**

```markdown
? BAD (ambiguous):
- Add caching

? GOOD (specific):
- [ ] Add LRU caching to XWCodec._encode() method
  - Cache size: 1000 entries
  - Eviction policy: Least Recently Used
  - Performance target: 50% reduction in encode time
  - Test coverage: 90%+
```

**Provide Context:**

```markdown
? BAD (no context):
## Objectives
- Improve performance

? GOOD (with context):
## Context
Current serialization of large objects (>1MB) takes 500ms average.
Users report timeout issues in production. Benchmark shows 80% time
spent in repeated encoding operations.

## Objectives
- [ ] Reduce serialization time for 1MB objects from 500ms to <100ms
- [ ] Implement caching to avoid repeated encoding of same data
- [ ] Maintain memory usage under 50MB for cache
```

### Routing Clarity

**Make it obvious which guides apply:**

```markdown
## Applicable Standards

**This is a DEVELOPMENT plan. Follow:**
- ? [GUIDE_DEV.md](GUIDE_DEV.md) - All development rules apply
- ? [GUIDE_TEST.md](GUIDE_TEST.md) - Testing strategy required
- ? [GUIDE_DOCS.md](GUIDE_DOCS.md) - API docs must be updated

**Specific sections to follow:**
- GUIDE_DEV.md § Code Quality Standards
- GUIDE_DEV.md § Performance & Security
- GUIDE_TEST.md § Unit Testing Standards
- GUIDE_DOCS.md § API Documentation Template
```

**Alignment targets:** ECSS-E-ST-40C, ISO/IEC 12207 & 15504, NASA NPR 7150.2, DO-178C Level A

This section maps the lifecycle defined in `guides/GUIDE_PLAN.md` to the compliance processes required for eXonware programmes. Reference it when preparing certification evidence or answering lifecycle audits.

### Phase-to-Process Mapping

| eXonware Phase (GUIDE_PLAN) | Primary Outputs (REF_PLAN) | ECSS-E-ST-40C Activity | ISO/IEC 12207 Process | NASA NPR 7150.2 / DO-178C Alignment | Notes |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|-------|
| **I. Ideation** (Capture & Define) | Idea briefs, requirements charters (`REF_IDEA.md`, `REF_PROJECT.md`) | 5.2 Concept & requirements definition | Stakeholder assessment, requirement elicitation | NPR 7150.2 �4.1 inputs; DO-178C planning data Annex A | Ensure security/usability considerations recorded before formal planning. |
| **II. Planning** (Execution Strategy) | Formal plans (`PLAN_*`), routing decisions (this REF), compliance checklists | 5.3 Project planning, 5.4 SW development planning | Project planning, software implementation planning | NPR 7150.2 �5.1, DO-178C �4.6 (plans) | Plans must cite applicable standards and enumerate verification gates. |
| **III. Development** (Build) | Implementation tasks, CHANGE logs, design notes | 5.5 Detailed design, 5.6 Implementation | Software construction, detailed design | NPR 7150.2 �5.2, DO-178C �5 | Plans capture coding guidelines, design constraints, and acceptance criteria. |
| **IV. Quality Loop** (Verify & Validate) | Test/benchmark sections, evidence routing | 5.7 Verification & validation | Verification, validation, joint reviews | NPR 7150.2 �5.3, DO-178C �6 | Each plan lists mandatory tests/benchmarks with traceable IDs. |
| **V. Release** (Deliver & Support) | Release checklists, follow-up tasks, maintenance notes | 5.8 Delivery & maintenance planning | Transition, operation, maintenance | NPR 7150.2 �5.4, DO-178C �7 | Plans define release authority, rollback strategy, and maintenance actions. |

### Traceability Workflow

1. **Capture Requirement IDs** in the plan header/objectives (link back to `REF_PROJECT.md` entries).  
2. **Map Tasks to Deliverables** using the "Related Deliverables" checklist (CHANGE/PROJECT/TEST/BENCH documents).  
3. **Record Verification Assets** in the Validation & Verification subsection with direct links to evidence folders.  
4. **Export Metadata** (requirement IDs → plan tasks → deliverables) to the traceability register in `docs/compliance/traceability/`.  
5. **Close the Loop** in completion reports by confirming each requirement ID has matching implementation and verification links.

### Release Checklist Template

Embed the following table in the release section of each PLAN or CHANGE document. During v0/v1 you can satisfy the items with manual links to guides/refs/logs; once the v2 automation lands, swap over to the generated artefacts.

| Item | Description | Evidence |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Traceability refreshed | Run `python tools/ci/generate_trace_matrix.py --package xwsystem` (plus other packages as needed) when metadata exists, **or** directly link the relevant PLAN/CHANGE/TEST docs. | `xwsystem/docs/compliance/traceability/TRACE_MATRIX.md` *(optional until v2)* |
| Risk register review | Confirm Critical/High risks have mitigation tasks and review dates. | `xwsystem/docs/compliance/risk-assessment/README.md` |
| Formal verification scope | Ensure components in `docs/compliance/verification/README.md` have current proof/test links. | PLAN or CHANGE document |
| Benchmark confirmation | Benchmarks meet SLAs; results logged. | `docs/logs/benchmarks/`, `REF_BENCH.md` |
| Documentation bundle | CHANGE/PROJECT/SUMMARY docs updated; release notes and rollback plan captured. | Relevant entries under `docs/logs/` |

Proceed with tagging/publishing only when every row is marked complete and reviewed by the release authority.

### Current Status (08-Nov-2025)

- ✅ Lifecycle-to-standards mapping documented above.  
- ✅ GUIDE_PLAN now references this REF as the canonical planning evidence source.  
- ✅ Automated trace matrix generation available via `tools/ci/generate_trace_matrix.py` and `.github/workflows/traceability.yml`.  
- ✅ Release/maintenance checklist defined (table above).  
- Tracking for ECSS-E-40C-RQ-001 maintained in `docs/compliance/standards/ecss/README.md`.
