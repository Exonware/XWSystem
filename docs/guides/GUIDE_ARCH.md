## Purpose

Define the architecture playbook for eXonware libraries, backend services, and front-end applications. This document is written for solution and platform architects; it captures the structural decisions, naming systems, layering rules, technology roadmap, and compliance targets that every project must respect.

---

## Scope

- Applies to all codebases within the eXonware ecosystem (`xwsystem`, `xwnode`, `xwdata`, `xwschema`, `xaction`, `xentity`, application libraries, backend APIs, front-end apps).  
- Covers multi-language strategy (Python today, Rust/Go/TypeScript facades tomorrow).  
- Interfaces with `GUIDE_DEV.md` (implementation standards), `GUIDE_MASTER.md` (shared constraints), and `REF_ARCH.md` (product-specific details).

---

## Definitions

- **Five Priorities:** Security ? Usability ? Maintainability ? Performance ? Extensibility. No lower priority can compromise a higher one.  
- **IClass / AClass / XWClass:** Interface, abstract base, and key extensible class naming scheme.  
- **Core-lib vs Facade-lib:** Core implements full capability (eventual Rust); facade exposes the API per language.  
- **Mars Standard:** Internal codename for the v2/v4 compliance milestones aligned with NASA/ECSS/DO-178C/CCSDS and emerging AI standards.

---

## Architecture Philosophy

1. **Priority-Driven Decisions:** Every architectural change documents explicit impact against the five priorities. Security wins over everything; extensibility never comes at the expense of the higher layers.  
2. **Contract-First Design:** Interfaces live in `contracts.py` (or language equivalent). Abstract bases in `base.py` implement cross-cutting logic. Public facades in `facade.py` provide the only supported entry points.  
3. **Pattern Stack:** Strategy, facade, template method, registry, adapter, decorator, pipeline, builder, observer, and command patterns are the default tools. Pick the minimal set that satisfies the priorities.  
4. **Composable Modules:** Break systems into capability domains (I/O, codecs, grammar, security, validation, caching, orchestration, UI). Each domain ships its own contracts/base/facade trio and can be reused by other libraries.  
5. **Lazy + Async by Default:** All I/O layers support async-first execution with clean sync wrappers that spin a new event loop. Lazy loading and initialization protect cold-start performance and memory budgets.  
6. **Observability and Governance:** Every module exposes telemetry hooks (structured logs, metrics, traces). Architecture decisions generate CHANGE/PROJECT artefacts so we can reconstruct intent later.

```

**Naming Rules**  
- Interfaces: `IExample`, defined in `contracts.py`.  
- Abstracts: `AExample(IExample)`, defined in `base.py`.  
- Key extensible classes: `XWExample`, returned by facades; `XW` prefix (eXonware) marks the canonical implementation.
- Domain-specific names (e.g., `SQLHandler`, `OrbitDataFormatter`) follow CapWords but only use the `X` prefix when they are primary extensibility points.

## Layered System Model

| Layer                     | Responsibility                               | Key Artifacts                                  |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Foundation (xwsystem)**| Serialization, codecs, security, validation, caching, threading, HTTP | Modules under `io/`, `codec/`, `security/`, etc. |
| **Graph/Data (xwnode, xwdata)** | Graph structures, data conversion, schema mapping | Custom node/edge strategies, data pipelines |
| **Schema & Action (xwschema, xaction)** | Schema enforcement, executable actions, workflow orchestration | Validation engines, automation frameworks |
| **Domain Entities (xentity)** | Entity management across schema + actions | Entity lifecycles, caching strategies |
| **Applications (xauth, xstorage, xbase, frontends)** | Product surfaces, APIs, UI | Microservices, UI components, orchestration |

Each downstream layer consumes the contracts/facades of its upstream dependencies. No module reaches into another library�s internals; all integration occurs through published interfaces.

---

## Design Patterns by Concern

- **API Boundary:** Facade + Adapter + Builder.  
- **Behaviour Selection:** Strategy + Chain of Responsibility.  
- **Lifecycle & State:** State + Observer + Command.  
- **Extensibility:** Registry + Plugin architecture + Dependency Injection via factories.  
- **Data Flow:** Pipeline orchestration + Template Method skeletons.  
- **Cross-Cutting Concerns:** Decorator (logging, retries), Proxy (lazy initialization, access control).  
- **Persistence & Caching:** Repository + Specification (query filters) + Cache-aside with `A*Cache`.  
- **UI/Frontend:** MVVM/Redux-style state isolation, adapter bridges to backend facades.

Architects are responsible for documenting which patterns apply per module and how they satisfy the priorities.

## Multi-Language Roadmap

| Version Phase | Core Implementation                             | Facades / SDKs                                  | Compliance Focus                    |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **0.x**       | Python core + facades (current)                  | Python                                           | Establish architecture, reach benchmarks |
| **1.x**       | Hardened Python core                             | Python                                           | Production readiness, full ecosystem |
| **2.x**       | Python core                                      | Python + begin Rust prototype                    | Draft Mars Standard (NASA/ECSS/DO-178C) |
| **3.x**       | Rust core (shared)                               | Python / Go / TypeScript facades                 | Multi-language parity, high-performance requirements |
| **4.x**       | Rust core                                        | Python / Go / TypeScript facades + other clients | Full Mars Standard compliance, certification |

Architecture plans must keep the Rust split in mind: contracts stay language-neutral, serialization uses formats portable to Rust, and async abstractions avoid Python-specific behaviour leaking into core interfaces.

## Compliance Frameworks

### Space & Safety (Mars Standard Targets)
- **NASA:** 8719.13 (Software Safety), 8739.7 (Engineering), 8739.8 (Software Assurance), NPR 7150.2D (Software Engineering).  
- **ECSS (ESA):** E-ST-40C (Software Engineering), Q-ST-80C (Product Assurance), E-ST-70-41C (Formal Methods), Q-ST-80-02C (Dependability), M-ST-20C (Data Exchange).  
- **DO-178C:** Aerospace certification (Level A focus for safety-critical modules).  
- **CCSDS:** Space data systems for protocol interoperability.

### Cybersecurity & IT Production
- **ISO/IEC 27001 family:** Information security management, controls, cloud privacy (27017/27018).  
- **NIST SP 800 series (pending formal adoption):** 800-53 (controls), 800-63 (identity), 800-160 (systems security engineering).  
- **OWASP / SLSA / Supply-chain controls:** Already part of security priority; map to architecture decisions.

### AI & ML Standards (extendable set)
- **NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF 1.0)** � foundation for trustworthy AI design.  
- **ISO/IEC 23894:2023** � AI risk management.  
- **ISO/IEC 42001:2023** � AI management system requirements.  
- **EU AI Act alignment (draft)** � risk classification and documentation when targeting EU deployment.  
- **IEEE 7000-series (optional)** � ethics and system transparency.  
Architects must ensure AI features (model training, inference pipelines, agent loops) document compliance posture and gaps in the Mars Standard tracker.

## Architectural Deliverables

1. **Architecture Decision Records (ADR):** Summarise context, decision, alternatives, priority impact, compliance considerations.  
2. **Module Blueprints:** Per major module, produce a diagram + narrative covering responsibilities, contracts, data flows, extension points, observability.  
3. **Compliance Matrix:** For releases targeting v2/v4 milestones, map components to NASA/ECSS/DO-178C/AI standards and record progress in the Mars Standard log.  
4. **Performance & Security Baselines:** Document required benchmarks (Guide Bench) and penetration/resilience expectations per module.  
5. **Integration Contracts:** For cross-library dependencies, include handshake diagrams (e.g., xwdata ? xschema) and failure-handling clauses.

---

## Coordination with GUIDE_DEV

- **GUIDE_ARCH** sets the architectural principles, layering, naming systems, compliance roadmap, and cross-library relationships.  
- **GUIDE_DEV** provides developer-level execution details (coding standards, imports, lazy install wiring, testing strategy).  
- Architects must ensure any new architectural requirement is mirrored by actionable tasks in GUIDE_DEV or CHANGE/PROJECT documents.

---

## Action Items & Open Gaps

- **ISO/NIST Coverage:** Create dedicated compliance packages mirroring the NASA/ECSS/DO-178C structure for ISO/IEC 27001/27017/27018, ISO/IEC 42001/23894, and NIST SP 800-series.  
- **AI Compliance Playbook:** Produce detailed checklists for AI RMF, ISO/IEC 23894, and EU AI Act to feed into Mars Standard documentation.  
- **Rust Migration Tracking:** Maintain a readiness matrix (ABI compatibility, FFI boundaries, serialization portability) to de-risk the v3 switch.  
- **Mars Standard Summary:** Consolidate the scattered documentation into a single authoritative reference under `docs/compliance/mars_standard/`.
